# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Personal workspace for modern C++ projects and learning exercises.

## Project Status

This is a new repository with no established build system or project structure yet. When adding code:

- Follow modern C++ standards (C++17 or later preferred)
- Establish build system when first code is added (CMake recommended for C++ projects)
- Set up appropriate directory structure based on project needs (e.g., `src/`, `include/`, `tests/`)

## Development Workflow

No build system or test framework has been established yet. These should be configured based on the first project added to this workspace.

**When setting up the first project, consider:**
- CMake for cross-platform build configuration
- A testing framework (Google Test, Catch2, or doctest)
- Compiler flags for modern C++ standards and warnings
- Static analysis tools (clang-tidy, cppcheck)

## Notes for Claude Code

- This is a learning/personal project workspace - experimentation is expected
- Wait for user direction on specific C++ standards, build tools, and project structure
- When user adds code, help establish appropriate build configuration and development workflow
